## A turbulent sniffle

Behold Edward Lear:

> “I was also sad, and thinking,  
> When one day I saw you winking,  
> And I heard you sniffle-snuffle,  
> And I saw your feathers ruffle:  
> To myself I sadly said,  
> ‘She's neuralgia in her head!  
> That dear head has nothing on it!  
> Ought she not to wear a bonnet?’  
> Witchy kitchy kitchy wee,  
> Spikky wikky mikky bee,  
> Chippy wippy chee!”
